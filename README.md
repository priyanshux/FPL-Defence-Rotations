# FPL-Defence-Rotations

## Created for Fantasy Premier League 2023-24

Did you know? If you pick both the Merseyside goalkeepers for the first 11 gameweeks, you can rotate them and play against FUL, BOU, WOL, shu, wol, WHU, LUT, BOU, nfo, EVE, NFO, lut. Most people would pass this considering their price but this repo helps you select the mathematically best possible rotation cases for your defenders out of all 15,504 options. 

Built on the philosophy of selecting attackers based on their form, and defenders based on their fixtures, FPL Defence Rotations is a tool that gives you the best options to rotate your defenders from in Fantasy Premier League according to favourable oppositions who play relatively less attacking football than the rest of the clubs.

## Updates, Issues and To-Do

1. Feature Request: Let managers choose their own Fixture Difficulty Ratings.
2. Feature Request: Take the Starting GW and Ending GW as input from the user and display the result.
3. Feature Request: Team Combos currently include all twenty clubs as default. Give the manager an option to select specific clubs as input and then prepare the corresponding combinations.
4. Enhancement: Write a script for combining the combinations CSV with the final results CSV.
5. Feature Request: Create a frontend dashboard to display the above mentioned features.
6. Enjoy the 2023-24 season :)

## Best Way To Use This Repo

1. I would recommend you go through all the possible options in the final result for each case.

2. Pick one/two defenders you HAVE TO get. For example - I'm locking Trippier.

3. Now if I'm targetting the first 10 gameweeks of the season and plan to have all 5 defenders in the squad. I would search in the GW10_4_2 sheet (since 1 spot is booked by Trippier). 

4. Don't stick to choices in the first 20 rows. There could be a good combination existing anywhere in the top 100 combinations.

### Frequently Asked Questions (FAQs)

#### 1. What do these numbers on the rating display?
The difficulty level to get a clean sheet in the specific match. It doesn't necessarily mean to tell you a lot about the overall defense of a team. The chances of these ratings increasing drastically would be much higher in the case of conceding 1 goal from no goals (costs you 4 points), when compared to the case of conceding 5 goals from 1 goal (costs you 2 points).

#### 2. Does it mean it doesn't consider the attacking returns?
No. Since attacking returns can be very player specific (For eg; Joe Gomez won't get as many returns as TAA) and even though Liverpool defenders have a greater probability of gaining more points than Fulham's, it is tough to allot them into numbers. More so since you rarely rotate defenders using their attacking returns.

#### 3. The Google Sheets attached is confusing me, how am I supposed to read it?
There are a total of 21 sheets attached inside the worksheet, which you should be able to navigate through from the bottom left icon in [Google Sheets](https://docs.google.com/spreadsheets/d/1blJu2sBmwoUA1Npiek3zm4vnPg7pBfS4KFraI2EdGQo/edit?usp=sharing). The names are assigned in the format of GWxx_y_z where xx denotes until which GW, y denotes the number of players you wish to rotate and z denotes the number of players in your starting 11. For eg; GW15_4_3 denotes the list of GW1-15 for rotating 4 players where 3 of them start in the playing 11.
